		<ul class="grid">
			<li>
				<h4>Behavior Evaluations</h4>
				<p>Individual consultations to assess and discuss your dogs training and management needs. During this time your dog will be evaluated to find a strategy and management system that fits both owner and dog. This process is helpful if you are deciding whether or not the dogs needs can be provided for. A behavioral evaluation and consultation is also helpful if you are unsure about a behavior your dog is exhibiting and if training can help.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Private Lessons</h4>
				<p>In-home training sessions are the best way to work on a specific problem or behavior with your dog. An in-home session is the less stressful for your dog than a group class and allows the trainer to examine the dog and behavior in his home enviornment. During the session a management plan for your dog will be put in place to continue training after the lesson is over. Private lessons can be offered at your home or a particular location, such as a park or neighborhood. Private lessons are the best option for dogs that have individualized needs or owners that have complicated schedules.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Group Classes</h4>
				<p>Group classes a great way to get out and socialize your dogs, which is especially important for puppies. At Sit Trust Stay there are three primary goals of group classes.</p>
				<h3>Puppy Classes</h3>
				<p>Puppy classes are designed to get your and your new dog off on the right paw. The classes meet at local parks and are aimed at sociability and bonding with their owners.</p>
				<h3>Engagement and Manners</h3>
				<p>These classes are designed to work on basic oedience, manners with their owners and out in public. Have a great time training your dog while out and about around parks and towns.</p>
				<h3>Reactive Dogs</h3>
				<p>If your dog is reactive, overly-friendly, or rude around other dogs or people - then this class will help your dog by setting up situations to desensatize them to their fears and temptations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Urban Mushing</h4>
				<p>Urban mushing is a great way for your high energy canines to release their energy and have fun. If you have a mountain bike, scooter, or even just want to run with your dog you should check out one of our Urban Mushing classes.</p>
